This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
The application I developed is powered by the Vite framework, which is renowned for its rapid development capabilities. It incorporates a router for seamless navigation between the FormView and ListView routes, which are the main views of the app.

To deliver the desired functionality, I crafted three essential components: ProductEdit, ProductForm, and ProductList. The ProductEdit component empowers users to modify product details, while the ProductForm component facilitates the addition of new products through a user-friendly form. The ProductList component displays a visually appealing list of products, providing an engaging user experience.

To ensure top-notch quality, I implemented a comprehensive testing suite that includes thorough tests for all critical components, including a meticulous test for the ProductList component. This meticulous approach helps identify and resolve any potential issues, ensuring the smooth functioning of the component.

For efficient state management, I leveraged Pinia, a widely-used state management library, to handle data retrieval and manipulation tasks seamlessly. This enhances the overall performance and user experience of the app.
